- Company: Joppy -- Insights: ['Full-time', '1-10 employees', 'Job poster joined LinkedIn in 2019'] -- Description: Una de las empresas con las que trabajamos busca un Backend Developer para que se una al equipo.

Este trabajo requiere ir a la oficina al menos 2 días a la semana en Barcelona.

¿Qué harás?

Te incorporarás a un equipo multidisciplinar donde plantearás, mejorarás y desarrollarás herramientas que nos permitan aportar soluciones poniendo a la clienta siempre en el centro.

Crecerás, aprenderás y también ayudarás a crecer. ¡Todo son retos en la empresa ahora mismo!

Y como #SayThingsAsTheyAre es uno de nuestros valores, queremos ser claros y transparentes en explicarte qué harás durante tus primeros 6 meses con nosotros.




En 1 mes...

Después del primer mes ya sabrás cómo está todo montado, te habrás empapado de nuestra cultura y conocerás la visión de la empresa.

Empezarás a entender de qué va el sector de la energía y qué necesitan nuestras clientas.
Habrás conocido a las personas con las que trabajarás mano a mano, tanto dentro como fuera del equipo.
Habrás participado en las sesiones del equipo y entenderás las dinámicas.
Habrás hecho algún deploy a producción
Habrás podido asistir a eventos internos cómo por ejemplo el Tech Show and Tell y a la Backend Crew para que fluya el conocimiento.




En 3 meses…

Habrás tenido varios 1:1s con tu responsable para saber cómo te sientes en tus primeros meses y ayudarte a crecer en base a tus intereses.
Seguro que ya habrás tomado muchas decisiones sobre cómo aportar valor a tu equipo y estarás trabajando codo con codo con tus colegas en cómo generar más impacto y conectar a las personas con la energía verde. 💡💚
Habrás disfrutado de algún team building con el equipo y ya te sabrás el nombre de algunas personas de otros equipos.




En 6 meses…

Tendrás (casi) todo bajo control y habrás contribuido en la madurez y crecimiento de tu equipo. Habrás aportado valor más allá de él compartiendo conocimiento e implicándote de lleno en mejorarlo continuamente.




¿Con quién lo harás?

#AlwaysPeopleFirst y #HaveFun son también valores muy importantes en la empresa, y es que en todo reto es importante que éste sea interesante pero también las personas con las que vas a compartir esta aventura.

Dentro del gran equipo de Tecnología, tenemos equipos por propósito. En tu caso, formarás parte del equipo de las Onefees. Si te preguntas de dónde viene el nombre quizás suena como OnePiece que es una serie que está muy bien y es uno de los mangas más vendidos del mundo 💰




¿Qué retos tenemos en OneFees?

Generar Engagement con nuestras clientas: Mejorar la experiencia de las clientas en el journey de facturación, cumpliendo con la promesa que pactamos cuando nos contrató y ayudándole a entender su factura a pesar de las complejidades del sector
Ser escalables: Ayudar a la compañía a crecer exponencialmente en clientas y nuevos productos que nos hagan marcar la diferencia y mover el mundo por la energía verde.




¿Y cómo sé si puedo encajar en este equipo?

Pues la verdad es que la diversidad es lo nuestro. Tenemos desde amantes de los juegos de mesa, personas que te harán verte la saga Marvel para estar en su honda, otra que si no sabes que es Regreso al futuro le costará mirarte sin llorar y a otras a las que nos representa Nathy Peluso. Además, estamos esparcidas por el país pero de vez en cuando nos gusta juntarnos y vernos en 3D para hacer un Team Building juntas.

En general, lo que nos une es que nos gusta trabajar en equipo y que somos haters del #blaming: Nuestro mantra es los éxitos y fallos los celebramos juntas y ambos los usamos como oportunidades para aprender. ¿Te animas a unirte a la tripulación? 🚀




¿Dónde lo harás?

Otra forma de #KeepRowing es remar todos juntos en perfecta sincronización y hacia un objetivo común, y qué mejor lugar para hacerlo que en nuestras oficinas de Barcelona a sólo 200 metros del mar 🌊. Esta excepcional ubicación al lado de la playa es perfecta para hacer un break con chapuzón y poder poner en práctica otro de nuestros valores #HaveFun.

Esta excepcional ubicación al lado de la playa es perfecta para hacer un break con chapuzón y poder poner en práctica otro de nuestros valores #HaveFun. Pero desde marzo se han multiplicado por casi 200 las ofis.

Estamos trabajando el flexible seating en la oficina y habilitando taquillas individuales para todxs, a la vez que estamos equiparando todas las salas de reuniones para poder hacer mejores vídeo-conferencias y que sigamos trabajando lo más cómodxs posible desde casa o desde la oficina.




¿Qué estamos buscando?

Que tengas 2 años de experiencia en Backend.
Construimos soluciones para nuestras clientas usando y , y a veces nos peleamos con legacy en PHP. Además, somos autónomas para desplegar nuestras aplicaciones e infraestructuras en usando Terraform. No es necesario que sepas de todo éste stack tecnológico, pero sí tener interés por aprender de él :)
Te preocupa la calidad del código. Consideramos que QA es una skill y no un rol.
Tienes interés por Extreme Programming y metodologías que nos permitan entregar valor lo antes posible a nuestras clientas.




¿Qué ofrecemos?

Por ello, ofrecemos una serie de medidas para que puedas desarrollarte 360º y conseguir todo aquello que te propongas, tanto a nivel personal como profesional.

- Company: Proton | Privacy by Default -- Insights: ['Full-time · Associate', '201-500 employees · Technology, Information and Internet', '2 school alumni', 'Actively recruiting'] -- Description: A better internet, where privacy is the default, is possible. Building this better internet might seem daunting or even unthinkable, but at Proton, this is what we do every day.




Proton was founded in 2014 by a group of scientists who met at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Our first product, Proton Mail, is now the world’s largest encrypted email service. Subsequent Proton products, such as Proton VPN, Proton Calendar, and Proton Drive, give our users full control over how and with whom their data is shared.




Today, Proton makes privacy universally accessible. Journalists from outlets like The Guardian and The New York Times, some of the world’s largest organizations, and people in more than 180 countries have signed up for over 70 million accounts. Our diverse and dynamic team is made up of more than 400 members representing over 40 different nationalities. While we are based in Geneva, Switzerland, we have offices in Zurich, Prague, London, Vilnius, Skopje, Taipei, and many more employees working remotely around the world.




Join one of Europe’s fastest-growing companies to help us solve challenging problems and build new products that will reach hundreds of millions of people. We want to create more than just one of the world’s most impactful tech companies; we want to create a new internet that serves the interests of all people. We need you, your voice, your ideas, and your ambition to make it happen.




Purpose of the role




The MSA department is a highly multi-disciplinary group started in 2019 to tackle difficult mail delivery, spam and abuse problems. We built sophisticated systems from scratch that combine human intelligence and machine learning to make tens of millions of realtime or asynchronous decisions each day. As of 2022, our three areas of focus are 1) mail delivery and spam, 2) abuse and account security, and 3) site reliability of Proton. Over the past 3 years, our custom systems have reduced spam filter misclassifications by over 50%, blocked millions of abusive bulk signups, protected hundreds of thousands of users from account compromise by attackers, and mitigated hundreds of DDoS attacks. In order to move fast with limited resources, we are organized into autonomous teams responsible for the whole system, with expertise across infrastructure, data storage, backend, frontend, machine learning, security and operational excellence. In 3 years, we grew from 2 engineers to over 30 engineers and analysts, spread across 3 continents for 24/7 coverage. We are looking for humble, mission-driven, systems-thinking people who want to make a big impact in a startup environment.




What you will do




MSA builds and maintains many backend services responsible for different domains. You will work with other engineers and analysts to design and build new features for these systems. As an engineering-driven organization, MSA currently doesn't have product or project managers, so you will have the opportunity to play those roles and lead the whole planning and development process. You will be responsible for the operational excellence of the systems and their interaction with other systems. The work is heavily focused on data engineering and using data to make sophisticated and automated decisions. You may work on MSA's custom systems written in Python or on the main Proton API written in PHP.




Deep experience with Python, PHP, or Go
Experience building complex production systems, especially involving big data
Experience with data processing and storage (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Kafka, Elastic, Ceph, ClickHouse)
Experience with managing Linux servers, including infrastructure as code (Puppet, Ansible) and containerization
Able to work autonomously and lead the whole development process, from design to QA
Excellent English communications, both written and spoken
Experience with machine learning and real-time prediction systems would be a plus
Experience with JavaScript, React, Typescript, and jQuery would be a plus




Why you should join Proton

Your work will set the foundation for Mavenoid applications that help people around the world get better support for their hardware devices. You will primarily work on the TypeScript backend, from technical implementation of features to designing the system architecture to ensuring application security and reliability and helping us grow the team. You will start hands-on, by building backend services in our TypeScript codebase that form the foundation for new product features, but before long we expect you to contribute ideas on how you see our product grow and mature.

The backend runs TypeScript on NodeJS, backed by PostgreSQL, and deployed to Google Cloud and Heroku. We have a GraphQL API with generated types, so we’re type-safe from the database to the CSS. Our frontend is a React app written in TypeScript. The ML/AI services are written in Python and interact with the Typescript backend via APIs.

Parts of the backend infrastructure are maintained as open-source projects by Mavens, such as atdatabases, funtypes. Everything else is in a mono-repo hosted on GitHub.




This role is remote-eligible from countries in CEST 2+/- hours time zone.

Complete Mavenoid’s remote onboarding program.
Meet with the entire Product team to understand what is being worked on.
Familiarize yourself with our platform and product, and processes.
Ship a few small features or performance improvements.
Design your initial 90-day action plan.




In your first three months, you will

Ship your first major feature to production.
Collaborate with frontend and/or machine learning engineers when making technical decisions.
Collaborate with the rest of the team to bring your input on the system architecture and the product.




In your first six months, you will

Propose, discuss, coordinate and implement your first large platform or architecture change.
Be familiar with a large portion of the platform, including the details of our CI/CD pipeline, machine learning services and integrations to external systems.
Own a part of the platform and be able to identify the areas of improvement.




Responsibilities

Build new product features in collaboration with other engineers, designers and product managers.
Ensure high availability and adherence to security standards for our platform.
Continuously improve monitoring and alerting systems.
Manage integrations with internal and external systems.




Qualifications

4+ years of experience as a backend engineer
Experience building web applications using TypeScript or JavaScript on NodeJS or Deno.
Experience designing APIs via REST, GraphQL or WebSockets.
Experience building and maintaining the infrastructure for deploying and running backend services.
Ability to take complete ownership of a feature or a project.
Ability to traverse the technical stack upwards and downwards from the backend as needed, solving problems with deployments and making tweaks to the frontend.
Good communication and collaboration skills.







What we offer




- Remote-first policy: Work from home or, if you prefer, from one of our office in Stockholm

- Employees’ work-life balance: flexible working hours and 25 days paid leave + national bank holidays.

- Employees’ wellness: free food during working hours, bi-weekly meditation sessions, and up to $500 as a Health Perk.

- Company: Nextail -- Insights: ['Full-time · Mid-Senior level', '51-200 employees · Software Development', 'Actively recruiting'] -- Description: As you may know, roles in Data teams are a mess. Given the needs of the team, we are looking for a strong backend engineer with an interest in data engineering, to act as the Tech Lead of the team. Initially, as you will mainly work on the data platform engine, it's your software development skills that will matter the most, specifically, Extreme Programming's Incremental Design, and a good testing discipline. However, the domain of that piece of software (and future ones) is data engineering: thus, you will need to develop a good understanding of that realm.

We work remotely but you can also work in Madrid offices. At the moment we are only seeking candidates in Europe (UTC+02:00 or similar).




OUR TEAM




You will be part of Nextail's Data Platform team. In the short/medium term, the team has the following main areas of focus:

Developing the "data platform engine": An ambitious service to manage Snowflake (and possibly other data) resources, involving Infrastructure as Code in a declarative style, and database version control.
Data governance, monitoring, observability, and cost control over Snowflake.
While we migrate to Snowflake, keep the lights on for the current solution (based on Amazon Aurora MySQL and Redshift).




In the future, the team will also be responsible for additional important parts of a data platform based on the Modern Data Stack, such as a data catalog.

The team is composed by:




Mario López (Engineering Manager)
Daniel López (Data Engineer)
Adrián Miralles (Data Engineer)




We offer




A highly innovative and fast-paced environment. As in any startup, expect to find a team with an interesting mix of business profiles (without the slides), IT geeks, data scientists, and as a fashion tech startup, a few fashion victims.
The satisfaction of delivering something new to the world that will have a strong impact both on retailers’ top line and on customer satisfaction. Contribute to the development of cutting-edge artificial intelligence & machine learning technologies that will build the next generation of retail systems.
The opportunity to work with top client decision-makers in the fashion retail industry and sharpen your business reasoning and interpersonal skills. Learn from peers from top consulting firms and the best global business schools.
Flexibility in remote work and office hours, use of some of the most advanced collaborative tools.
Periodic company get-togethers to meet the rest of the team.







Job Requirements




First of all, we are looking for a good workmate to join the team. We value working in a safe and constructive environment where everybody can thrive over any specific technical skill.

In our team, you will also find people focused on generating an impact in the company, rather than just taking on new tasks to develop. We expect that the person who joins us is as excited about this bias towards impact and action as we are.




The requirements and valued skills for this job are:




Strong backend experience of at least 5 years, working with complex products and powerful teams.
The data platform engine is written in Python, and the team writes quite a good deal of SQL. We don't discriminate by frameworks, we are looking for the right kind of person, even if you have to transition to other technologies, so we encourage you to apply if your core language is Java, .Net, or any other.
Knowledge and interest in design patterns, SOLID, Hexagonal Architecture; everything related to software architecture and design.
Knowledge and experience applying good development practices like TDD, CI/CD, etc.
Experience working in fast-paced product-oriented startups.




And remember, even if you don't have some of the requirements, don't hesitate to contact and tell us what you would like to bring to the team, we are always open for the right person 😀

*Nextail is an equal-opportunity employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity, or Veteran status.

- Company: Terminal -- Insights: ['Full-time · Mid-Senior level', '51-200 employees · Software Development', 'Actively recruiting'] -- Description: About Vivun

Vivun is a global provider of Buyer Experience (BX) software. Its AI-powered platform supports a family of products that enables B2B businesses to meet the demands of today’s sales-proof buyer, differentiate from the competition, and accelerate revenue. With PreSales at the forefront of the buyer experience, companies can align Sales with Product, provide repeatable workflows for their solution experts, deliver on-demand product expertise, and win more deals with transparency and trust.

About The Role

As a Back-End engineer, you will be responsible for designing, building, and managing performant and resilient distributed systems. You’ll design intuitive developer-friendly interfaces to data via REST/GraphQL APIs. You’ll write tests to validate that the API contract is adhered to, and author services and data systems to implement the desired interfaces. Your job will involve architecting and evolving distributed collaborating microservices for maintainability, and ensuring the system and its components scale gracefully with increased data and load from users, external systems/3rd party integrations, and inter-service communication. You will write high quality, readable/maintainable code, reusable infrastructure modules, and high quality documentation. You’ll write automated unit, contract, and load tests. You will also identify and resolve performance bottlenecks and issues in production.

Vivun embraces DevOps as a culture. As such, you will be responsible for ensuring the stability of the systems you build in production. You will need to author contributions that can be safely and automatically promoted and tested. Your services and applications must be instrumented with logging, tracing, and metrics to ensure they are diagnosable and monitored continuously for failure. You will be responsible for configuring and responding to alerts when issues occur.

What you'll do

As a Back-End engineer, you will be responsible for educating the broader team and cross-pollinating knowledge and good ideas. Your unique perspective and detailed system-level awareness will make it critical that you understand and communicate risks and problems where others might not perceive them. Be ready to help other engineers grok the big ideas behind building performant and resilient systems.

Vivun engineers are responsible for disrupting the status quo with great ideas and valuable feedback. An important part of your job is to introduce and evaluate new tools and technologies, evolve quality standards, and provide insightful feedback on proposals, design artifacts, and code contributions. Help create a culture where everyone learns and evolves rapidly.

What you bring

5-10 years of experience in software engineering individual contributor role
Technical depth. Back-End engineers need to have in-depth experience building scalable, performant distributed systems. Ideal candidates have professional experience with Building REST / GraphQL APIs, Microservices / Event based architecture (Kafka), Kotlin/Springboot, Python/FastAPI/Flask/Graphene, Javascript/NodeJS/Apollo, Hasura/Haskell, SQL and NoSQL Databases (PostgreSQL, Redshift/Spectrum, DynamoDB, DocumentDB/Mongo), In-Memory Caches (Redis/Memcached), Containers / Orchestration (Docker, ECS Fargate, K8s), Cloud-native Infrastructure as Code (AWS, terraform), Testing automation (unit tests, contract/integration testing, end-to-end, load testing), Distributed Observability/Monitoring, and CI/CD.
Principled, Scientific, and Quantitative Thinkers. Vivun values Back-End engineers who strive to deeply understand the causes of observed outcomes. The best are unsettled when they can’t understand the reasons why unexpected events occur. Vivun needs quantitative thinkers who are comfortable with making quantitative, statistically informed predictions of how a system is likely to perform under load, and who can also empirically validate or refute alternative hypotheses / predictions and communicate effectively with numbers and visualizations.
Defensive Engineering Mindset. We need engineers who deeply understand nuances, edge cases, limitations, and risks of the systems, technologies, and tools at their disposal, and have the battle scars to prove it. Can you anticipate the various failure modes, and design a system that can handle them? If you have experience authoring maintainable, resilient, multi-tenant salesforce applications at scale, and if you have well-informed opinions about observability, testing automation, performance, and resilience, let’s chat.
Creative and Systematic. Can you create order from chaos? Building excellent products is not easy; it takes both creativity, and rigorous systematic thinking to drive clarity and consensus. The ideal candidate can brainstorm in the space of possibilities, and pivot quickly to synthesizing clear interfaces and acceptance criteria.
Tenacious Problem Solver. Do you become obsessed when you encounter challenging problems? Whether it’s understanding what caused that gnarly production bug, or achieving performance improvements others believe is impossible, we’re looking for those who enjoy the challenge. Ideal candidates are systematic, scientific thinkers who can quickly figure out what’s true and what to do about it.
Growth mindset. We need lifelong, continuous learners who crave constant improvement. Building an outstanding product and company is extremely hard, and the ideal candidate understands that the growth you will experience by taking on this challenge is the real reward.
Ownership. Do you naturally take initiative to make improvements without others asking for them? Do you experience joy when your projects move forward? Do you go the extra mile to ensure your peers are succeeding? Do both the big picture and the details matter to you? If so, let’s chat.

Our growth is underpinned not only by an overwhelming culture of positivity and can-do attitude, but also by our amazing product - one that helps our customers to manage all of their software subscriptions and in turn, scale their operational processes, comply with regulations and save money.

We are backed by leading investors, including Techstars and Anthemis, and have received global recognition:

FinTech 50 'Hot Ten' company in 2020 for being one of the fastest-growing fintech startups in Europe

At Factorial we're looking for a Senior / Staff Software Engineer to help us take our Time & Space Domain team to the next level. 📈 We want to develop the extremely talented people in our team, scale the company culture and evangelize our views on how Human Resources can make a difference for organizations all over the world. 🌎




Time & Space Domain ⏳🚀

One of the most important domains in Factorial is Time, and now has evolved to tame Space. Its mission is to gather accurate time management data to provide relevant insights, generating value for our clients by reducing uncertainty, helping them to anticipate needs, foresee problems, and improve the well-being of their employees.

Our goal in Time & Space is to help employees manage their employees' work schedules, improve our clients' experience when it comes to set up time tracking policies, review and approve timesheets and export data. We offer tools to plan shifts and schedules, and link data to tracking tools, leaves and holidays. We aim to help our clients plan ahead and be more productive, making employees life easy on assessing their worked hours, clocking in and out or just doing their timesheets at the end of the week or month. And also manage their workspace, the way they access and share it, helping hybrid (Remote + on site) companies to scale.

All of this not only providing a good user experience through our web but also through a mobile application, QR codes management and cutting edge technologies like face recognition plus more biometrics capabilities.




The Role 🔨

At Factorial we have a team of +100 very talented Full Stack developers. We are looking for engineers who can wear many hats, abstract problems, and find creative solutions. We look for smart people who are curious, proactive, and have good soft/communication skills.

We are not looking for a long list of skills and technologies. Our stack is React/React-native for the clients and Ruby on Rails for the backend, but it’s not mandatory to be proficient on those (most of the team came with other areas of expertise which is very enriching). We believe that someone who has good aptitudes and is hungry for learning is what works best.

Working at an startup / scale-up like Factorial means making a bigger impact and learning more. In terms of the day-to-day work, you will enjoy the freedom to tackle big technical challenges your own way, working alongside a group of experienced developers and joining in at a critical stage in the company's future success.




What will you be doing? 👀

Proficient in all relevant technical skills, and able to move quickly because of deep understanding of large portions of codebase.
Make well-reasoned design decisions, identifying potential issues, trade-offs, risks, and the appropriate level of abstraction.
Expert in our processes, also helping to define/document them.
Write meaningful clean code and perform code reviews.
Handle open-ended problems and ambiguity well.
Deploy to production multiple times per day.
Have full ownership (and accountability) of which features to build and how to ship them.
Share your knowledge or learn from others through one of our monthly tech talks, weekly lunch or our dev.to blog.
Be trusted by the Factorial team. We want to work with you because we think you can solve the problems in your own way and we trust that you will be able to manage your time and schedule.
Learn from and work with a team of extremely experienced developers, in a very quality-oriented environment.
Mentoring: You love to share your experience and expertise to help others grow.




Your profile ✅

You should be a learner: you want to improve your skills not only in the engineering field but across any other areas.
You should be an owner: You like proposing new hypotheses and be responsible for building, deploying and validating them.
You know how to create an app from the scratch (back-end and front-end) and you know the pros and cons of different technologies and tools.
You have experience in several coding languages (especially for backend development), CI/CD tools and cloud technologies.
You have few years of experience working as a software engineer.
You have to be comfortable with communicating in English.
The annual salary is ‎€ 55.000 for Senior Software Engineers or € 70.000 for Staff Software Engineers.




At Factorial we don't evaluate you by the years of experience you have, we evaluate your knowledge and skills. How are we doing it?




We have a Career Path with a rubric framework where we define what is expected for each experience level and skill we're evaluating. This framework will allow you to know at which level you're right now and what you need to continue growing in the company.




As we love transparency (it's one of our hiring values), our Career Path includes the salaries for each level and we share it during the first interview to make sure we're aligned.




We're a remote-friendly company so you can apply from anywhere in the world, which English is our official language so this is the only one you need to succeed at Factorial!

- Company: The Trade Desk -- Insights: ['Full-time · Mid-Senior level', '1,001-5,000 employees · Technology, Information and Internet', 'Actively recruiting'] -- Description: The Trade Desk is a global technology company with a mission to create a better, more open internet for everyone through principled, intelligent advertising. Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100 times the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at an unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, ownership, empathy, and collaboration. We value the unique experiences and perspectives that each person brings to The Trade Desk, and we are committed to fostering inclusive spaces where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work every day.

Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a dynamic, globally-connected team where your contributions will make a meaningful difference in building a better media ecosystem? Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small-medium-sized workplaces globally.

About the Role:


Our Software Engineers are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, building, and delivering products for our clients.
We have dozens of individual, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to work on large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces – to name a few.
Software Engineers contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and/or direct management of small teams, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.


Who We Are Looking For:


You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful software projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled engineer, accustomed to developing web services. You have experience building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our engineers have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by "the way things have always been done". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.


What We Care About:

What and how you can contribute is what’s important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

Our culture runs much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...) – the people we want on our team are trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.

Does this sound like you? If so, we welcome your application and the chance to meet you.

Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without a contract in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk.

We aim to help our clients plan ahead and be more productive, making employees life easy on assessing their worked hours, clocking in and out or just doing their timesheets at the end of the week or month. And also manage their workspace, the way they access and share it, helping hybrid (Remote + on site) companies to scale.

All of this not only providing a good user experience through our web but also through a mobile application, QR codes management and cutting edge technologies like face recognition plus more biometrics capabilities.

The Role 🔨

At Factorial we have a team of +100 very talented Full Stack developers. We are looking for engineers who can wear many hats, abstract problems, and find creative solutions. We look for smart people who are curious, proactive, and have good soft/communication skills.

We are not looking for a long list of skills and technologies. Our stack is React/React-native for the clients and Ruby on Rails for the backend, but it’s not mandatory to be proficient on those (most of the team came with other areas of expertise which is very enriching). We believe that someone who has good aptitudes and is hungry for learning is what works best.

Working at an startup / scale-up like Factorial means making a bigger impact and learning more. In terms of the day-to-day work, you will enjoy the freedom to tackle big technical challenges your own way, working alongside a group of experienced developers and joining in at a critical stage in the company's future success.

What will you be doing? 👀

Proficient in all relevant technical skills, and able to move quickly because of deep understanding of large portions of codebase.
Make well-reasoned design decisions, identifying potential issues, trade-offs, risks, and the appropriate level of abstraction.
Expert in our processes, also helping to define/document them.
Write meaningful clean code and perform code reviews.
Handle open-ended problems and ambiguity well.
Deploy to production multiple times per day.
Have full ownership (and accountability) of which features to build and how to ship them.
Share your knowledge or learn from others through one of our monthly tech talks, weekly lunch or our dev.to blog.
Be trusted by the Factorial team. We want to work with you because we think you can solve the problems in your own way and we trust that you will be able to manage your time and schedule.
Learn from and work with a team of extremely experienced developers, in a very quality-oriented environment.
Mentoring: You love to share your experience and expertise to help others grow.


Your profile ✅

You should be a learner : you want to improve your skills not only in the engineering field but across any other areas.
You should be an owner: You like proposing new hypotheses and be responsible for building, deploying and validating them.
You know how to create an app from the scratch (back-end and front-end) and you know the pros and cons of different technologies and tools.
You have experience in several coding languages (especially for backend development), CI/CD tools and cloud technologies.
You have few years of experience working as a software engineer.
You have to be comfortable with communicating in English.
The annual salary is ‎€ 55.000 for Senior Software Engineers or € 70.000 for Staff Software Engineers.


At Factorial we don't evaluate you by the years of experience you have, we evaluate your knowledge and skills. How are we doing it?

We have a Career Path with a rubric framework where we define what is expected for each experience level and skill we're evaluating. This framework will allow you to know at which level you're right now and what you need to continue growing in the company.

As we love transparency (it's one of our hiring values), our Career Path includes the salaries for each level and we share it during the first interview to make sure we're aligned.

We're a remote-friendly company so you can apply from anywhere in the world, which English is our official language so this is the only one you need to succeed at Factorial!

Company story




ForwardKeys is an innovative travel analytics company. It was established in 2010 when the founders realised that the air reservation data used by airlines could serve every industry with an interest in global travellers. Since then, we have built an online platform through which our clients monitor and qualify traveller flows, map global demand and forecast travel trends. Our team now comprises over 70 people and continues to grow – and we are always looking to develop new datasets and products to help our clients understand the travel landscape.

Company culture

The working environment at ForwardKeys is international, challenging and flexible:




International because our employees come (and work) from all around the world, just like our clients.
Challenging is making the transition from a start-up to a bigger company, and everything that entails – from developing and selling new products to seeking and seizing new opportunities.
Flexible means we understand that doing your job well is more important than being in the office from 9 to 6. To ensure everyone is working towards the same goals, we have biannual company weeks during which we make sure to have fun.

🤝 HELP US HELP THE WORLD AGREE MORE




Juro has big ambitions: de-throne MS Word as the standard way to do contracts. And we'll need a lot of help doing it.




Legal tech on the rise: companies in this space already attracted more than $1 billion in funding this year as the slow-moving industry digitises. With 3x annual revenue growth, we're in a great position to pilot this change.




Working alongside a small team of passionate developers, you will be integral to the secure design, implementation and operational management of the systems and services based on AWS automating the way people agree. You will help to improve our best practices around application, infrastructure and data security throughout our lifecycle.










🌠 YOUR MISSION




To build on our engineering culture at Juro.

You will help us define, develop and improve Juro infrastructure and backend services using Typescript and Node.js.




🚧 When you join our Integrations team, you will:

- Develop, maintain and improve new and existing integrations with third-party services.

- Maintain, fix and enhance by writing new parts of our public Juro API.

- Develop an interface that helps to manage integrations.

- Optimise and analyse integrations performance efficiency

- Work with microservice architecture environment using Docker, Kubernetes.




🏔 WHY JOIN US?




🛠️ You decide what is best.

You will have the autonomy to make decisions, define tooling and contribute to processes that lead to the best outcomes. You can propose new tools and systems for solving problems.




🦖 No legacy technologies.

We use a modern stack including TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Redis. As a bonus, you will have debugging tools such as Sentry, Loki, Grafana and a geek tool for task tracking — Linear.




💥 Make an impact.

We a still small team — ca. 5 engineers per workstream. As a result, your impact on what we build will be significant: you will see the results of your work not in months, but in weeks.




🔧 Time to fix.

Every other week we have tech retro - if you see a problem, something doesn’t work for you, or you wanna improve anything - we have a space for this.

Also we have Maintenance week - once every 6 weeks we have a week to work on technical debt or bugs which you never find time to fix.




👀 Code review to help you grow.

Our PR’s are rigorous, but that’s because we believe in them as an opportunity to keep improving and for wider knowledge transfer. Of course, where appropriate we will also pair or mob to get the best results.




🌈 Join the #1 startup to work for in 2022: https://tinyurl.com/juro-no-1

We're immensely proud being voted #1 of the top 50 London startups to work for in 2022. This is the result of hard work, to show not tell, and make Juro the best place to work for. This spans from setting concrete steps become a truly diverse, inclusive workplace, to investing in a culture of growth, to offering flexibility to everyone and more.




For 2022, we plan on expanding on all of these areas — what benefits we offer, how we give and receive feedback and how we foster a genuine sense of belonging for all Jurors to bring their full and best selves to work.







📬 WE'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU IF...




- You developed applications and APIs using TypeScript and Node.js.

- You were involved in project architecture: creating architecture from scratch, making structure changes or migrating from old to new structures.

- Created and maintained distributed and resilient systems and familiar with Kafka, Redis and cloud services.

- Created and integrated API, both internal and third-party services such as Google API, SendGrid, Intercom, Greenhouse, Workday, Zapier, Hubspot




At Juro, we approach our work in line with our values:

🙏 #BeMoreHuman

Mentoring: You use your technical expertise to teach / guide others patiently.




🚀 #StriveToDeliver

Autonomy: You are empowered to find the right solutions to our customers needs. You are comfortable working independently but also work well and trust others in your team and the teams around you.




❤️ #LoveTheDetails

Caring: You take responsibility for what you build because you care. You proactively seek/give feedback to suggest improvements.

️

👌 #KeepItSimple

Focus on results: You deliver the tasks and projects that you promise, and you don't invent new solutions if an appropriate one already exists.




🌈 Research shows that while men apply to jobs if they meet ~60% of criteria, women and those in traditionally underrepresented groups tend to apply only if they check all boxes. So if you think you have what it takes but don't meet every single point above, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit.







⛰️ OUR MISSION




Help the world agree more by making contracts frictionless and accessible to everyone.




Businesses run on contracts. But it can take five separate tools just to agree one simple agreement. Switching between Word, eSignature and your inbox while you chase files creates admin for legal and friction for the business. And at a scaling business, there’s no time for contracts to block growth.




But what if your business could self-serve on contracts, while legal stays in control of contract process? That’s why we founded Juro: the all-in-one contract automation platform that helps legal counsel and the teams they enable to agree and manage contracts in one place.




Old-fashioned contract systems are built for handling static files. Juro’s flexible template editor makes it simple to create and collaborate on contracts in the browser, as well as integrate contracts into your other tools. Simple contracts are agreed faster, with better collaboration between teams.




Put contracts on autopilot — so your business can focus on growth.

Acerca de IOMED

IOMED es una empresa emergente de tecnología líder en el campo de la extracción y el procesamiento masivos de datos médicos. Está formada por un equipo unido, joven, dinámico y flexible, que tras varios años de trabajo conjunto, se caracteriza por su agilidad, gusto por el trabajo y simpatía. Por ello, buscamos candidatos con ganas de innovar, lanzar un proyecto relevante y crecer con él, disfrutando siempre del trabajo en equipo y de los retos, que son muchos, cada día.

Como empleador, ofrecemos igualdad de oportunidades. Queremos hacer crecer nuestro equipo con personas talentosas y dinámicas que quieran dejar su huella en el campo de la IA y la investigación, independientemente de su raza, color, religión, origen nacional, género, discapacidad física o edad.

Lo que hacemos

Hoy en día, alrededor del 50 % de los ensayos clínicos se retrasan debido a la lenta recopilación de datos de los pacientes, que se realiza de forma manual. Como resultado, la investigación clínica es altamente ineficiente tanto en tiempo como en costo, y lleva años y miles de millones de dólares desarrollar un nuevo medicamento.

Este problema podría solucionarse a través de los Real-World Data, es decir, los contenidos en las historias clínicas electrónicas (HCE). Pero, lamentablemente, hasta el 85 % de los datos clínicos existentes no están estructurados.

IOMED ha encontrado una solución a esta situación, haciendo posible aprovechar al máximo el valor de los datos clínicos del mundo real. Desarrollamos una herramienta que extrae los datos necesarios de los textos clínicos, dando como resultado una base de datos estructurada, estandarizada e interoperable que contiene información clínica completa de los hospitales.

De esta forma, la información no reutilizable se transforma en datos disponibles para la Investigación Clínica, lo que permite aumentar el número de pacientes que cumplen los criterios, así como reducir el tiempo total y el trabajo manual dedicado a esta tarea.

Get to Know Our Team




In Agoda’s Back End Engineering department, we build the scalable, fault-tolerant systems and APIs that host our core business logic. Our systems cover all major areas of our business: inventory and pricing, product information, customer data, communications, partner data, booking systems, payments, FinTech and more. These mission-critical systems change frequently with dozens of releases per day, so we must employ state-of-the-art CI/CD and testing techniques in order to make sure everything works without any downtime. We also ensure that our systems are self-healing, responding gracefully to extreme loads or unexpected input. In order to accomplish this, we use state-of-the-art languages like Scala and Go, data technologies like Kafka and Spark, and agile development practices.

We are interested in speaking to persons of any level from individuals just starting their IT careers to experts in their field, although this particular position is better suitable to veteran engineers, with expertise in certain technologies, and especially those that had lead projects, initiatives and/or teams.




In This Role, You’ll Get to




Think and own the full life cycle of our products, not just a single piece of code – from business requirements, technology selection, coding standards, agile development, unit and application testing, to CI/CD and proper monitoring
Design, develop and maintain platforms across the back end area
Improve scalability, stability, and efficiency of our existing systems
Write great code and help others write great code
Collaborate with other teams and departments




What You’ll Need To Succeed




5+ years’ experience under your belt developing performance-critical applications that run in a production environment using Scala, Java or C#

Data platforms like SQL, Cassandra or Hadoop. You understand that different applications have different data requirements
Good understanding of algorithms and data structures
Strong coding ability
You are passionate about the craft of software development and constantly work to improve your knowledge and skills
Excellent verbal and written English communication skills




It’s Great If You Have




Experience with Scrum/Agile development methodologies
Experience building large-scale distributed products
Core engineering infrastructure tools like Git for source control, TeamCity for Continuous Integration and Puppet for deployment

Our Mass Customization Platform is comprised of modular, multi-tenant services. Our businesses can choose the solutions that work for them, or assemble any custom combination they need. This makes it easier and faster to do things like introduce new products, reach customers and track orders. And this kind of innovation keeps customers coming back. Just last year, Cimpress generated $2.88B in revenue through customized print products, signage, apparel, packaging and more.

We encourage our engineers to think like an owner – to continue to act small as we grow. Every team defines their own roadmaps, and uses the programming languages and technologies that suit them best. This helps us have a big impact at the enterprise level while still feeling small and nimble.

What You Will Do

As Full-stack Software Engineer, you will join one of our product teams. We believe in ownership, and you will have a mandate (together with your team) to develop features end-to-end. At Cimpress, we are big on autonomy, and that makes us strong: we expect you to make all (technical) choices along the way to build solutions for our customers.

ElasticSearch
React, Styled Components, ThreeJS, CanvasJS.
C# .NET Core
Your Qualifications:

At Cimpress, we value the experiences that individual team members add to our culture. Please don't hesitate to apply even if you don't meet the exact qualifications, we look forward to learning more about you!

Ability to contribute at multiple levels of our stack.
Experience with agile software development and a desire to write (and review) code every day.
Nice to have:

Experience designing API’s with some curiosity for the front-end will be amazing!
A strong desire for self-improvement, and an aim to control your own learning. In other words: research which training you need and who can coach you, and we will provide the funding and time.

Being at Cimpress means that you don’t see work as just a building, a desk or a manufacturing floor. You see it as a chance to take a step forward in your career journey – and your life. We strive to give you everything you need to learn, grow, and succeed. Through innovation, collaboration, and perpetual exposure to what’s next, we’re always pushing boundaries and broadening our horizons.

We're Remote-First

We heard from our team members that having the freedom, autonomy and trust in each other to work from home and, the ability to operate when they are most productive, empowers them to be their best.

Currently we are enabled to hire remote team members in over 30 US States as well as several countries in Europe, including Spain, Germany, UK, Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Switzerland.

About Us

Led by founder and CEO Robert Keane, Cimpress invests in and helps build customer-focused, entrepreneurial mass customization businesses.

- Company: Nextail -- Insights: ['Full-time', '51-200 employees · Software Development', 'Your profile matches this job'] -- Description: As you may know, roles in Data teams are a mess. Given the needs of the team, we are looking for a strong backend engineer with an interest in data engineering, to act as the Tech Lead of the team. Initially, as you will mainly work on the data platform engine, it's your software development skills that will matter the most, specifically, Extreme Programming's Incremental Design, and a good testing discipline. However, the domain of that piece of software (and future ones) is data engineering: thus, you will need to develop a good understanding of that realm.




We work remotely but you can also work in Madrid offices. At the moment we are only seeking candidates in Europe (UTC+02:00 or similar).




Our team:




You will be part of Nextail's Data Platform team. In the short/medium term, the team has the following main areas of focus:




Developing the "data platform engine": An ambitious service to manage Snowflake (and possibly other data) resources, involving Infrastructure as Code in a declarative style, and database version control.
Data governance, monitoring, observability, and cost control over Snowflake.
While we migrate to Snowflake, keep the lights on for the current solution (based on Amazon Aurora MySQL and Redshift).




In the future, the team will also be responsible for additional important parts of a data platform based on the Modern Data Stack, such as a data catalog.




The team is composed by:




Mario López (Engineering Manager)
Daniel López (Data Engineer)
Adrián Miralles (Data Engineer)




We offer:




A highly innovative and fast-paced environment. As in any startup, expect to find a team with an interesting mix of business profiles (without the slides), IT geeks, data scientists, and as a fashion tech startup, a few fashion victims.
The satisfaction of delivering something new to the world that will have a strong impact both on retailers’ top line and on customer satisfaction. Contribute to the development of cutting-edge artificial intelligence & machine learning technologies that will build the next generation of retail systems.
The opportunity to work with top client decision-makers in the fashion retail industry and sharpen your business reasoning and interpersonal skills. Learn from peers from top consulting firms and the best global business schools.
High flexibility: We’re strong believers that what matters most are results. Each Nextailer is empowered, through trust and ownership, to organize their time as they see fit without jeopardizing the time or work of their colleagues.
Remote and relationships first Nextail has been a remote first company since its beginnings. Yet we believe in the power of direct human interaction. Therefore teams gather in person on a quarterly basis and the Nextail house in the center of Madrid is open all year long to all Nextailers.Periodic company get-togethers to meet the rest of the team.
International environment: We operate across the globe, with recent operations reaching from Europe all the way to Australia, and our team alone consists of professionals of more than 23 different nationalities. While many of us are multilingual, our working language is English.
Diversity on all levels: United as a single team, we celebrate diversity at every dimension*. Professionally speaking, are you ready to work alongside tech geniuses, data science magicians, and fashionistas? You’ll have teammates with extensive experience in a wide variety of professional fields, including technology, retail, consulting and entrepreneurship.
Performance allowance: To let people perform at their best, each Nextailer has an annual performance allowance of 1,000 EUR as well as 2 days off for professional development. You’ll be provided with a laptop of your choice so you can work with the tools that are most comfortable for you!
Flexible compensation plan: We offer a fixed + variable salary as well as company equity.


Desired Skills and Experience
First of all, we are looking for a good workmate to join the team. We value working in a safe and constructive environment where everybody can thrive over any specific technical skill.




In our team, you will also find people focused on generating an impact in the company, rather than just taking on new tasks to develop. We expect that the person who joins us is as excited about this bias towards impact and action as we are.




The Requirements And Valued Skills For This Job Are




Strong backend experience of at least 5 years, working with complex products and powerful teams.
The data platform engine is written in Python, and the team writes quite a good deal of SQL. We don't discriminate by frameworks, we are looking for the right kind of person, even if you have to transition to other technologies, so we encourage you to apply if your core language is Java, .Net, or any other.
Knowledge and interest in design patterns, SOLID, Hexagonal Architecture; everything related to software architecture and design.
Knowledge and experience applying good development practices like TDD, CI/CD, etc.
Experience working in fast-paced product-oriented startups.




And remember, even if you don't have some of the requirements, don't hesitate to contact and tell us what you would like to bring to the team, we are always open for the right person 😀




Nextail is an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.
